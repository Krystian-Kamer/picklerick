<h2>ðŸ¥’ Pickle Rick project</h2>
<ul>
  <li> I present my Pickle Rick project. This is a project to test my skills. The project is created using VITE, React and Typescript. In addition, I use React Router, Firebase, Redux Toolkit, React query and Tailwind and React Toastify library.</li>
  <li> My site has 4 main pages - home and 3 categories - characters, locations and episodes, and if You are logged in also library.</li>
  <li>In characters page You can search characters by name, gender and status. In results you will have characters that meets your criteria. Also here I'm using useInfiniteQuery, so You will have infinite scroll, as on Instagram. You can click on image or on button with text "More info" to see single character. In single character page You can find more info about character and also check in what origin or location character is. If you are logged in You can add this character to your favorite character list - that is available on Library page.</li>
  <li> In locations page, you can select any location that appears in the world of Rick & Morty and see what characters are in it.</li>
  <li> In episodes page, you can select each episode and check what characters featured in following episode.</li>
  <li> In library page, you can see what characters you like the most. To delete character you must click on character and then click button below with text 'remove from your library'.</li>
  <li> In footer you will find information about me and how to contact me</li>
